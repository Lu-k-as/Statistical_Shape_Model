% Task 1 - Covariance matrix
% (a) Implement a function ourCov.m, that computes the covariance matrix C of a data
%     matrix D. Using the matlab built-in function cov for implementation is prohibited but
%     it can be used to compare your results (cov takes a n Ã— d matrix as input). (3 points)
% (b) Compute C for all matrices in daten.mat. Visualize the data utilizing plot in separate figures 
%     and set the axis to equal scale (axis equal). Interpret the resulting
%     covariance matrices C of all datasets! Which position in C holds which information?
%     (3 points)
